# A simple detail to improve your heatmap

This is a very short essay I wrote to show what I think is a very important detail to make sure a correlation-matrix heatmap is is easily interpretable.

The main point is using a diverging color scale and making sure it is adequately centered at 0. Otherwise, it can be hard to tell positive and negative values apart.

The heatmaps were created in the *heatmap.ipynb* notebook, and the article I posted on medium is in the file *medium_post.md*.
